<h2>About me</h2>
I started playing with computers from a young age. I was always fascinated by the way they worked and how they could be used to create things. I started with simple games and animations, and then moved on to building websites. I love the feeling of creating something from scratch and seeing it come to life. I am always looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills.<br><br>

I haven't stopped learning and creating since then. I'm involved in multiple projects and I'm always looking for new challenges to push myself in both my career and personal life.
